# killer-helper

This is a simple app I wrote to teach myself both Vue.js and killer cage sudoku. Simply save the killer.html file to your machine and then load that file in your browser and away you go. The only network traffic involved is Vue.js and Bootstrap CDNs. Everything else is completely local.
